# SimpleTimer for Arduino

This is a fork of the SimpleTimer library by Christopher Schirner (https://github.com/schinken/SimpleTimer).
Currently it's identical to the original SimpleTimer library by Marcello Romani (http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/SimpleTimer) without the std::function callbacks but functional as a stand-alone library alongside a default installation of Arduino.

## Additional Features

* ~~Support lambda-expressions / std::function callbacks~~
